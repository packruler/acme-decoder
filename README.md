# Acme Exporter

This is a simple container that will automatically export certificates from an `acme.json` file into files.
At this time this container supports exporting Let's Encrypt certificates generated by Traefik an stored in
an `acme.json` file.

## Traefik Configuration

Setup a Traefik to use an `acme.json` file to store Let's Encrypt certificate data. You can learn how to do
this in the [Traefik Let's Encrypt Documentation](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/https/acme/#storage).

## Simple Run

Run `docker run -v <dir containing acme.json>:/data ghcr.io/packruler/acme-exporter`

## Result

2 directories will be added to the folder containing the acme.json file. The `certs` directory is the
directory where all certificate files will be stored in files named `<certificate domain>.crt`. The `priv`
directory is where all the private key files will stored in files named `<certificate domain>.key`.
